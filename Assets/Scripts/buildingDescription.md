Building: Going building first should not allow you to steamroll anyone who hasn't. As they are the unique source of income (possibly with some spell), they
should be costly and slow (high building time?). Multiple building can be imagined: market for +gold, windmill for +food, smith for improvement? Upgrade center
could also be a thing (unlocks t2, which makes t2 rush difficult), but it makes sense to link the building path to t2 as it is economic advantage. The tech tree
should start slow and not grants a lot of stuff (start with smith, which does nothing on its own?)
THe building path should still offers some defense, which can be walls and defensive buildings? Maybe tower?


Building road:

HallCenter>>
LumberMill	-> Windmill*3 -> Warehouse?
			-> Boucher ->? Smith
			

LumberMill: a few gold
Windmill: a few food
Boucher: a few action point? Agains gold/food?
Smith: improvement? +1Atck, +1regen, +1armor?
Warehouse: allow for keeping food?/mana? between turns? Other stuff?
Quarry: lose food agains gold?
market?
