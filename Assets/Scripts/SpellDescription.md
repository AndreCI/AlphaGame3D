Need to think about the general balance and ideas behind magic
-> try to assign magic tree to playstyle, then balance
give clear and coherent bondaries between schoolom
brainstorm ideas: 
	arcane=cheap, quick, non effective, low impact, mana sink   [COLOR:WHITE/VIOLET/DARKBLUE] PINK?
	fire=aoe, self damage, aggression, buffs					[COLOR:RED/ORANGE/YELLOW]
	frost=control, mana gain, disruption (food removal?)		[COLOR:BLUE/CYAN/VIOLET]
	green=value, economic power (food & gold?), heal			[COLOR:GREEN/YELLOW/CYAN]
	void=powerful, costly, high cooldown, combos?				[COLOR:VIOLET/BLACK]
Each schoolom should have spells available to all that represents its spirit:
	arcane=[{Deal a little damage(2?) for 1 mana with no cooldown: cheap, non optimal, quick, low impact, mana sink}
		{Create a wall (with HP, attackable) which disappears after X turns?: quick, low impact}
		{3 missiles that target units randomly in a 3 or 4 tiles radius: cheap, quick, low impact}
		]
	fire=[{AOE deal 5 + apply burn (5dpt) for 2 turns (15damage total) to all units: aoe + self damage}
		{AOE attack buff + 5 for 3 turns: buff + aoe}
		{Unique powerful buff which deals damage (deal 5, the units gain +Attack, +armor, +mvtpoints?): self damage, aggression, buff}
		]
	frost=[{Spend all remaining mana, get it back next turn: mana gain, mana sink}
		{Deal X damage and hardfreeze a unit: control, disruption}
		{Destroy X food and generate mana for each player?: control, disruption, mana gain}
		]
	green=[{Deal honest damage(10) which doesn't cost an AP: value, economic power} #Damage doesn't fit
		{Heal a unit for X and make it not consume food for Y turns?: heal, economic power}
		{Apply regeneration buff in aoe and cleanse other effect?: heal, value}
		{Create a plant which provides 1 food a the start of the turns and can be destroyed (limitation on spwan placement): value, economic power}
		] #Need gold gain?
	void=[{Apply specific debuff: exemple: start of turn, take X damage, where X is the number of turns remaining on the effect}
	{Exploit specific debuff: exemple: Deals X damages to a unit, if it dies & had the debuff, it explodes and apply the debuff to nearby enemies}
	]?
