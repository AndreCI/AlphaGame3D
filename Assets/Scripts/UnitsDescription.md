Units: the idea is to have a gradation in units power as the game goes, along as a more versitality options. Units are supposed to be various, with unique
traits and have some synergies (with others units but also with spells).
The gradation comes from the tech tree, as the first building (barracks) unlock the basic units. Then, multiple building can be purchased to unlock specific
units. Using the t2 system, the goal is to make it difficult (and non efficient) to unlock every units.
Unique traits can not be achieved by mere stats only, which enforces the idea that giving ability to units is good. A range of weyworks allow to complexify
the units in general without adding to much reading difficulty (armor, regen, etc.)
Finally, linking the units to the spell system schoolom could allow to 1° make the tech tree more diverse, as each schoolom could have its own recruitement
building, 2° link more heavly a player to its schoolom commitment, and thus making the game more diverse. Design wise, it good as well (more commit to a color=
playstyle more coherent and with more "personnality")
